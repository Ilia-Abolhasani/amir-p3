                       INSTALLATION of mfold 3.5

mfold version 3.5 uses a configure script.

Some non-interactive mfold_util programs, in particular, sir_graph and
boxplot_ng, are included so that structure and dot plots can be
created. It is preferable to have the mfold_util-4.6 versions of these
programs.  

With this version, no environment variables are required. Energy and
related files will be read from the installation data directory,
usually /usr/local/share/mfold (or $prefix/share/mfold, where $prefix
is specified by using --prefix= when running ./configure).

After running ./configure (or the more convenient ./Configure.bash
script), 

make

compiles the Fortran, C and C++ programs and creates the mfold and
mfold_quik scripts.

make install

places the binaries and scripts into $prefix/bin and data files into
$prefix/share/mfold. These directories are created if they do not
already exist.

As in earlier versions, the current working directory will be searched
first for energy files when the folding program is run.

Please report bugs, other problems or suggestions to zukerm@rpi.edu
Look at the files in the "doc" directory, especially the manual, which
is in PostScript, pdf and HTML form.
